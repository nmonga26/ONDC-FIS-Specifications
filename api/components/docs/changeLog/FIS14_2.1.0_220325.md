| :------ | :----------------- |

##### Mutual Funds:

****22nd March 2025****
- Using seller app as provider and moving amc name into item creator object
- Adding ability to place multiple items in an order (cart functionality)
- Adding redeem by units and redeem functionality
- Using quote object to capture stamp duty, stt etc breakups
- Using update apis for cancellation, instead of cancel apis. This allows for part cancellation when there are two items in an order.
- example fix: sip instalment payment failure shouldn't fail the fulfillment and shouldn't cancel the order
- fix: using uppercase in quote object title attribute
- Adding child order installment ids to the parent sip order
- example fix: removing cancellation terms from redemption on_update examples
- fix: capturing source bank account type in the payments objects to facilitate payments through different bank a/c than the given payout bank a/c
- fix: adding granular payment methods to allow custom ux build for the buyer apps
- Capturing mandate limit in a separate tag in payments to support having a separate sip debit amount (matching with the order amount) and mandate limit amount. This is useful in a scenario where debit is made along with the mandate authorization - amount in payments object represent the debit and mandate limit tag represents the max limit on the mandate.
- Adding other services - ability to create zero balance folio
- Adding other services - ability to create kyc independent of a purchase order
- Adding other services - ability to register a payment mandate independently
