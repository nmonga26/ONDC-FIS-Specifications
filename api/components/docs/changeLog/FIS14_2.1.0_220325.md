| Version | FIS14_2.1.0_220325 |
| :------ | :----------------- |

##### Mutual Funds:

****22nd March 2025****
- Using seller app as provider and moving amc name into item creator object
- Adding ability to place multiple items in an order (cart functionality)
- Adding redeem by units and redeem functionality
- Using quote object to capture stamp duty, stt etc breakups
- Using update apis for cancellation, instead of cancel apis. This allows for part cancellation when there are two items in an order.
- example fix: sip instalment payment failure shouldn't fail the fulfillment and shouldn't cancel the order
- fix: using uppercase in quote object title attribute
- Adding child order installment ids to the parent sip order
- example fix: removing cancellation terms from redemption on_update examples
- fix: capturing source bank account type in the payments objects to facilitate payments through different bank a/c than the given payout bank a/c
- fix: adding granular payment methods to allow custom ux build for the buyer apps
- Capturing mandate limit in a separate tag in payments to support having a separate sip debit amount (matching with the order amount) and mandate limit amount. This is useful in a scenario where debit is made along with the mandate authorization - amount in payments object represent the debit and mandate limit tag represents the max limit on the mandate.
- Adding ability to create sip without setting a payment mandate upfront and ability to later add a new mandate to the sip
- Adding ability to collect payment and set mandate together in one payment call
- Adding ability to manually trigger an sip instalment. This can be used to make payment for the first instalment instantly at the time of the sip creation.
- fix: keeping payment.params.amount to zero in case of SIP orders as there is no payment collection involved in an SIP order. That will help in payment object being self contained for the seller app to determine if a debit has to happen or not - in case of payment mode being upi autopay where auth and debit is possible together.
- fix: adding allocated object in items even for failed fulfillments to keep the structure consistent
- Adding ability to modify sip: amount change, pause
- Adding ability for the buyer app to collect payments from the investor and settle it to the AMCs
- Adding other services - ability to create zero balance folio
- Adding other services - ability to create kyc independent of a purchase order
- Adding other services - ability to register a payment mandate independently
- Adding the ability to place order in an external folio i.e a folio created previously outside of the seller app
- fix: `on_confirm` calls for redemption and switch has fulfillment state as `INITIATED`
- Adding ability to provide instructions to generate first instalment of an sip immediately irrespective of the actual schedule
