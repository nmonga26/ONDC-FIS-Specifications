      calculated pro rata for each calendar day of delay. As an example, if the
      value is set as "7.3", and the amount of payment due is INR 1000, that
      will mean the Payment Collector will pay the counterparty Network
      Participant an interest of 7.3% per annum (i.e. INR 100), calculated pro
      rata for each day of delay. So if the Payment Collector delay was 50 days,
      the total interest payable would be INR 10 [calculated as
      1000x(7.3/100)x(50/365)]

      to the transaction, in addition to the terms decided through the ONDC
      Protocol. If there is a conflict between the terms decided through the
      Protocol, and the Static Terms, the terms decided through the ONDC
      Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the Static
      Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network
      Participant Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the Network
      Participant Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail.
  - Term: Offline Contract
    Api: search on_search
    Attribute: OFFLINE_CONTRACT
    Owner: Both
    Value: true/ false
    Description: >-
      OFFLINE_CONTRACT is a boolean field denoting the presence or absence of an offline contract
      between Network Participants (NPs). When set to true, it indicates the existence of a formalized 
      contract outside of transaction-level agreements. This offline contract holds precedence over
      transaction-level contracts, governing the relationship between the involved NPs. Conversely, 
      when set to false, it suggests that contractual arrangements are solely based on transaction-level
      contracts, without overarching offline agreements.

      Case 1: Buyer NP and Seller NP agrees on the term
      Buyer NP sets OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "FALSE" in the Search call
      Seller NP also sets the OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "FALSE" in the On_Search call.   

      Case 2: Buyer NP and Seller NP disagrees on the term
      Buyer NP sets OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "FALSE" in the Search call
      Seller NP sets the OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "TRUE" in the On_Search call 

      However, Buyer NP can choose to move ahead in the journey by changing the OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "TRUE"
      in the subsequent API calls in the same transaction. OR else make start a new transaction with a  
      Search call with the OFFLINE_CONTRACT set to "TRUE".
