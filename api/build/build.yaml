        Doctor in the healthcare sector, a driver in the mobility sector, or a
        delivery person in the logistics sector. This object can be set at any
        stage of the order lifecycle. This can be set at the discovery stage
        when the BPP wants to provide details on the agent fulfilling the order,
        like in healthcare, where the doctor's name appears during search. This
        object can also used to search for a particular person that the customer
        wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this object gets instantiated
        after the order is confirmed, like in the case of on-demand taxis, where
        the driver is assigned after the user confirms the ride.

    Context:
      description: >-
        Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a high-level
        overview to the receiver about the nature of the intended transaction.
        Typically, it is the BAP that sets the transaction context based on the
        consumer's location and action on their UI. But sometimes, during
        unsolicited callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
        is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
        request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP. The context
        object contains four types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information
        about the transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
        `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and receiving

        protocol version that implemented by the sender and,</li><li>Transaction

        sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key
        to encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
        passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
        implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during the
        synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the context
        must be sent during all interactions,

        keeping in mind relevance, performance, and opportunity cost. It is

        those terms, it must overwrite the terms and return them to the BAP. If
        overridden, the BAP must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP in
        order to preserve the provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
        case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform offline
        negotiations on the payment terms. Once an agreement is reached, the BAP
        and BPP can resume transactions.

            be approximated to one-dimensional regions like roads, railway
            lines, or shipping lines. 3 dimensional regions are rarer, but are
            gaining popularity as flying drones are being adopted for various

    XInput:

        Contains any additional or extended inputs required to confirm an order.
        This is typically a Form Input. Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
        is not enough for the BPP to confirm an order. For example, to confirm a
        flight ticket, the airline requires details of the passengers along with
        information on baggage, identity, in addition to the class of ticket.
        Similarly, a logistics company may require details on the nature of
        shipment in order to confirm the shipping. A recruiting firm may require
        additional details on the applicant in order to confirm a job
        application. For all such purposes, the BPP can choose to send this
        object attached to any object in the catalog that is required to be sent
        while placing the order. This object can typically be sent at an item
        level or at the order level. The item level XInput will override the
        Order level XInput as it indicates a special requirement of information
        for that particular item. Hence the BAP must render a separate form for
        the Item and another form at the Order level before confirmation.

        This is the annual rate of interest that the Payment Collector will be
        charged if they delay a payment to the counterparty Network Participant,

        the value is set as "7.3", and the amount of payment due is INR 1000,
        that will mean the Payment Collector will pay the counterparty Network
        Participant an interest of 7.3% per annum (i.e. INR 100), calculated pro
        rata for each day of delay. So if the Payment Collector delay was 50
        days, the total interest payable would be INR 10 [calculated as
        1000x(7.3/100)x(50/365)]

        Conditions of the Network Participant - which are not covered in the API
        Specification (e.g.: indemnity) - will be hosted. These terms will apply
        to the transaction, in addition to the terms decided through the ONDC
        Protocol. If there is a conflict between the terms decided through the
        Protocol, and the Static Terms, the terms decided through the ONDC
        Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the Static
        Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network
        Participant Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the
        Network Participant Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail.
    - Term: Offline Contract
      Api: search on_search
      Attribute: OFFLINE_CONTRACT
      Owner: Both
      Value: true/ false
      Description: >-
        OFFLINE_CONTRACT is a boolean field denoting the presence or absence of
        an offline contract between Network Participants (NPs). When set to
        true, it indicates the existence of a formalized  contract outside of
        transaction-level agreements. This offline contract holds precedence
        over transaction-level contracts, governing the relationship between the
        involved NPs. Conversely,  when set to false, it suggests that
        contractual arrangements are solely based on transaction-level
        contracts, without overarching offline agreements.

        Case 1: Buyer NP and Seller NP agrees on the term Buyer NP sets
        OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "FALSE" in the Search call Seller NP also sets the
        OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "FALSE" in the On_Search call.   

        Case 2: Buyer NP and Seller NP disagrees on the term Buyer NP sets
        OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "FALSE" in the Search call Seller NP sets the
        OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "TRUE" in the On_Search call 

        However, Buyer NP can choose to move ahead in the journey by changing
        the OFFLINE_CONTRACT to "TRUE" in the subsequent API calls in the same
        transaction. OR else make start a new transaction with a   Search call
        with the OFFLINE_CONTRACT set to "TRUE".
